200 proofs earth is not a spinning ball

by Eric Dubay 1 the horizon always

appears perfectly flat 360 degrees

around the observer regardless of

altitude all amateur balloon rocket

plane and drone footage show completely

flat horizon over 20-plus miles high

only NASA and other government space

agencies show curvature and they're fake

cgi photos and videos to the horizon

always rises to the eye level of the

observer as altitude is gained so you

never have to look down to see it if

earth were in fact a globe no matter how

large as you ascended the horizon would

stay fixed and the observer would have

to tilt looking down further and further

to see you 3 the natural physics of

water is to find and maintain its level

if earth were a giant sphere tilted

wobbling and hurdling through infinite

space then truly flat consistently level

surfaces would not exist here but since

earth is in fact an extended flat plane

this fundamental physical property of

fluids finding and remaining level is

consistent with experience and common

sense 4 rivers run down to sea level

finding the easiest course

north-south-east-west and all other

intermediary directions over the earth

at the same time if earth were truly a

spinning ball then many of these rivers

would be impossibly flowing uphill for

example the Mississippi in its 3,000

miles would have to ascend 11 miles

before reaching the Gulf of Mexico 5 one

portion of the Nile River flows for a

thousand miles with a fall of only one

foot parts of the West African Congo

according to the supposed inclination

and movement of the ball earth would be

sometimes running uphill and sometimes

down this would also be the case for the

piranhas Paraguay and other long rivers

6 if earth were a ball 25,000 miles in

circumference as NASA and modern

astronomy claimed spherical trigonometry

dictates the surface of all standing

water must curve downward and easily

measurable 8 inches per mile

applied by the square of the distance

this means along a six-mile channel of

standing water the earth would dip six

feet on either end from the central peak

every time such experiments have been

conducted however standing water has

proven to be perfectly level seven

surveyors engineers and architects are

never required to factor the supposed

curvature of the earth into their

projects canals railways bridges and

tunnels for example are always cut and

laid horizontally often over hundreds of

miles without any allowance for

curvature 8 the Suez Canal connecting

the Mediterranean with the Red Sea is a

hundred miles long without any locks

making the water an uninterrupted

continuation of the two seas when

constructed the Earth's supposin

curvature was not taken into account it

was dug along a horizontal datum line 26

feet below sea level passing through

several lakes from one sea to the other

with the datum line and the water's

surface running perfectly parallel over

the hundred miles mine engineer W

Winkler was published in the earth

review regarding the Earth's supposed

curvature stating as an engineer of many

years standing I saw that this absurd

allowance is only permitted in

schoolbooks no engineer would dream of

allowing anything of the kind

I have projected many miles of railways

and many more of canals and the

allowance has not even been thought of

much less allowed for this allowance for

curvature means this that it is eight

inches for the first mile of a canal and

increasing at the ratio by the square of

the distance and miles

thus a small navigable canal for boats

say 30 miles long will have by the above

rule an allowance for curvature of 600

feet think of that and then please

credit engineers is not being quite such

fools nothing of the sort is allowed we

no more think of allowing 600 feet for a

line of 30 miles of railway or canal

than of wasting our time trying to

square the circle Tim the London and

North Western Railway forms a straight

line 180 miles long between

in Liverpool the railroads highest point

Midway at Birmingham station is only 240

feet above sea level

if the world were actually a globe

however curving 8 inches per mile

squared the 180 mile stretch of rail

would form an arc with the center point

at Birmingham raised over a mile a full

5,400 feet above London and Liverpool 11

a surveyor and engineer of 30 years

published in the Birmingham weekly

mercury stated I am thoroughly

acquainted with the theory and practice

of civil engineering

however bigoted some of our professors

may be in the theory of surveying

according to the prescribed rules yet it

is well known amongst us that such

theoretical measurements are incapable

of any practical illustration all our

locomotives are designed to run on what

may be regarded as true levels or flats

there are of course partial inclines or

gradients here and there but they are

always accurately defined and must be

carefully traversed but anything

approaching to eight inches in the mile

increasing as the square of the distance

could not be worked by any engine that

was ever yet constructed taking one

station with another all over England

and Scotland it may be stated that all

the platforms are on the same relative

level the distance between eastern and

western coasts of England may be set

down as 300 miles

if the prescribed curvature was indeed

as represented the central stations at

rugby or warwick ought to be close upon

three miles higher than a chord drawn

from the two extremities

if such was the case there is not a

driver or stoker within the kingdom that

would be found to take charge of the

Train we can only laugh at those of your

readers who seriously give us credit for

such venturesome exploits as running

trains round spherical curves horizontal

curves on levels are dangerous enough

vertical curves would be a thousand

times worse and with our rolling stock

constructed as at present physically

impossible 12 the Manchester Ship Canal

Company published in the earth review

stated it is customary in railway and

canal constructions for all levels to be

referred to a datum which is nominally

horizontal

and is so shown on all sections it is

not the practice in laying out public

works to make allowances for the

curvature of the earth 13 in a 19th

century French experiment by mm Bo and

arago a powerful lamp with good

reflectors was placed on the summit of

desire dolo pomace in Spain and able to

be seen all the way from camporee on the

island of Ibiza since the elevation of

the two points were identical and the

distance between covered nearly a

hundred miles

if the earth were above all twenty five

thousand miles in circumference the

light should have been more than sixty

six hundred feet a mile and a quarter

below the line of sight fourteen the

lieutenant-colonel Portlock experiment

used oxy-hydrogen Drummond's lights and

heliostats to reflect the sun's rays

across stations set up across a hundred

and eight miles of st. George's channel

if the earth were actually a ball twenty

five thousand miles in circumference

port locks light should have remained

hidden under a mile and a half of

curvature fifteen if the earth were

truly a sphere twenty five thousand

miles in circumference airplane pilots

would have to constantly correct their

altitudes downwards so as to not fly

straight off into outer space

a pilot wishing to simply maintain their

altitude at a typical cruising speed of

500 miles per hour would have to

constantly dip their nose downwards and

descend two thousand seven hundred and

seventy-seven feet over half a mile

every minute otherwise without

compensation in one hours time the pilot

would find themselves thirty 1.5 miles

higher than expected 16 the experiment

known as Ares failure proved that stars

move relative to a stationary earth and

not the other way around by first

filling a telescope with water to slow

down the speed of light inside then

calculating the tilt necessary to get

the Starlight directly down the tube

Airy failed to prove the heliocentric

theory since the Starlight was already

coming in the correct angle with no

change necessary and instead proved the

geocentric model correct seventeen

Olbers paradox states that if there were

billions of stars which are Suns the

night sky would

filled completely with light as Edgar

Allan Poe said with a succession of

stars endless than the background of the

sky would present us a uniform

luminosity since there could exist

absolutely no point in all that

background at which would not exist a

star in fact Olbers paradox is no more

paradox than George Aires experiment was

a failure both are actually excellent

reputations of the heliocentric spinning

ball earth model 18th the

michelson-morley and the sagnik

experiments attempted to measure the

change in speed of light due to Earth's

assumed motion through space after

measuring in every possible different

direction in various locations they

failed to detect any significant change

whatsoever again proving the stationary

geocentric model nineteen techo bra he

famously argued against the heliocentric

theory in his time positing that if the

earth revolved around the Sun the change

in relative position of the Stars after

six months orbital motion could not fail

to be seen he argued that the Stars

should seemed to separate as we approach

and come together as we received in

actual fact however after one hundred

and ninety million miles of supposed

orbit around the Sun not a single inch

of parallax can be detected in the Stars

proving that we have not moved at all

twenty if earth were truly constantly

spinning eastwards at over a thousand

miles per hour

vertically fired cannonballs and other

projectiles should fall significantly

due west

in actual fact however when this has

been tested vertically fired cannonballs

shoot upwards an average of 14 seconds

ascending 14 seconds descending and fall

back to the ground no more than two feet

away from the cannon often directly back

into the muzzle 21 if the earth were

truly constantly spinning eastward at

over a thousand miles per hour

helicopters and hot-air balloons should

be able to simply hover over the surface

of the earth and wait for their

destinations to come to them 22 if earth

were truly constantly spinning eastward

at over a thousand miles per hour during

the Red Bull stratosphere dive Felix

Baumgartner spending three hours

ascending over new

Sacco should have landed 2,500 miles

west into the Pacific Ocean but instead

landed a few dozen miles east of the

take-off point 23 bomb believers often

claim gravity magically and inexplicably

drags the entire lower atmosphere of the

earth in perfect synchronization up to

some undetermined height where this

progressively faster spinning atmosphere

gives way to the non spinning non

gravities non atmosphere of infinite

vacuum space such nonsensical theories

are debunked however by rain fireworks

burns bugs clouds smoke planes and

projectiles all of which would behave

very differently if both of the ball

earth and its atmosphere were constantly

spinning eastward at a thousand miles

per hour 24 if earth and its atmosphere

were constantly spinning eastward over a

thousand miles per hour then north south

facing cannons should establish a

control while east firing cannonballs

should fall significantly farther than

all others while West firing cannonballs

should fall significantly closer

in actual fact however regardless of

which direction cannons are fired the

distance covered is always the same 25

if earth and its atmosphere were

constantly spinning eastwards over a

thousand miles per hour than the average

commercial airliner traveling 500 miles

per hour should never be able to reach

its eastern destinations before they

come speeding up from behind

likewise westward destinations should be

arrived at thrice the speed but this is

not the case 26 quoting heaven and earth

by gabrielle Henriette if flying had

been invented at the time of Copernicus

there is no doubt that he would have

soon realized that his contention

regarding the rotation of the earth was

wrong on account of the relation

existing between the speed of an

aircraft and that of the Earth's

rotation if the earth rotates as it is

said at a thousand miles an hour and a

plane flies in the same direction at

only 500 miles it is obvious that its

place of destination will be farther

removed every minute on the other hand

if flying took place in the opposite

direction to that of the rotation a

distance of 1,500 miles would become

in one hour instead of 500 since the

speed of the rotation is to be added to

that of the plane it could also be

pointed out that such a flying speed of

a thousand miles an hour which is

supposed to be that of the Earth's

rotation has recently been achieved so

that an aircraft flying at this rate in

the same direction as that of the

rotation could not cover any ground at

all it would remain suspended in midair

over the spot from which it took off

since both speeds are equal 27 if earth

and its atmosphere were constantly

spinning eastwards over a thousand miles

per hour landing airplanes on such

fast-moving runways which face all

manner of directions north south east

west and otherwise would be practically

impossible yet in reality such

frictional concerns are completely

negligible twenty-eight if the earth and

its atmosphere were constantly spinning

eastwards over a thousand miles per hour

then clouds wind and weather patterns

could not casually and unpredictably go

every which way with clouds often

traveling in opposing directions at

varying altitudes simultaneously 29 if

the earth and its atmosphere were

constantly spinning eastwards over a

thousand miles per hour

this should somewhere somehow be seen

heard felt or measured by someone yet no

one in history has ever experienced this

alleged eastward motion meanwhile

however we can hear feel and

experimentally measure even the

slightest westward breeze 30 in his book

south sea voyages Arctic and Antarctic

Explorer Sir James Clark Ross described

his experience on the night of November

27th 1839 and his conclusion that the

earth must be motionless the sky being

very clear it enabled us to observe the

higher stratum of clouds to be moving in

an exactly opposite direction to that of

the wind a circumstance which is

frequently recorded in our

meteorological journal both in the

northeast and southeast trades and has

also often been observed by former

voyagers captain basil hall with nested

from the summit of the peak of Tenerife

and calsters lechi on ascending the

volcanic

mountain of Caronia in away he reached

at 4,000 feet an elevation above that of

the trade wind and experienced the

influence of an opposite current of air

of a different Hydra metric and

thermometric condition count straddle a

chi further informed me of the following

seemingly anomalous circumstance that at

the height of 6000 feet he found the

current of air blowing at right angles

to both the lower strata also of a

different thermometric condition but

warmer than the inter stratum such a

state of the atmosphere is compatible

only with the fact which other evidence

has demonstrated that the earth is at

rest thirty-one quoting zetetic

cosmogony thomas Winship states let

imagination picture to the mind what

force air would have which was set in

motion by a spherical body of 8,000

miles in diameter which in one hour was

spinning round thousand miles per hour

rushing through space at 65,000 miles

per hour and gyrating across the heavens

then let conjecture endeavor to discover

whether the inhabitants on such a globe

could keep their hair on if the earth

globe rotates on its axis at the

terrific rate of a thousand miles per

hour such an immense mass would of

necessity cause Truman a tremendous rush

of wind in the space it occupied the

wind would go all one way and anything

like clouds which got within the sphere

of influence of the rotating sphere

would have to go the same way the fact

that the earth is at rest is proved by

kite flying 32 if gravity is credited

with being a force strong enough to hold

the world's oceans buildings people and

atmosphere stuck to the surface of a

rapidly spinning ball then it is

impossible for gravity to also

simultaneously be weak enough to allow

little birds bugs and planes to take off

and travel freely unabated in any

direction 33 if gravity is credited with

being a force strong enough to curve

the massive expanse of oceans around a

globular earth it would be impossible

for fish and other creatures to swim

through such forcefully held water 34

ship captains in navigating great

distances at sea never need to factor

the supposin curvature of the earth into

their calculations both plain sailing

and the great circle sailing the most

popular navigation methods use plane not

spherical trigonometry making all

mathematical calculations on the

assumption that the earth is perfectly

flat if the earth were in fact a sphere

such an arrant assumption would lead to

constantly glaring inaccuracies plain

sailing has worked perfectly fine in

both theory and practice for thousands

of years however and plane trigonometry

has time and again proven more accurate

than spherical trigonometry in

determining distances across the oceans

35

if the earth were truly a globe then

every line of latitude south of the

Equator would have to measure a

gradually smaller and smaller

circumference

thus farther south travel if however the

earth is an extended plane then every

line of latitudes south of the equator

should measure a gradually larger and

larger circumference the farther south

traveled the fact that many captains

navigating south of the Equator

assuming the globular Theory have found

themselves drastically out of reckoning

more so the farther south traveled

testifies to the fact that earth is not

at all 36 during captain James Clark

roses voyages around the Antarctic

circumference he often wrote in his

journal perplexed at how they routinely

found themselves out of accordance with

their charts stating that they found

themselves an average of 12 to 16 miles

outside their reckoning every day later

on further south as much as 29 miles

thirty-seven lieutenant Charles Wilkes

commanded a United States Navy

exploration expedition to the Antarctic

from 1838 to 1842 and in his journals

also mentioned being consistently east

of his reckoning sometimes over 20 miles

in less than 18 hours 38 to quote

Reverend Thomas Milner in the southern

hemisphere navigators to India have

often fancied themselves east of

Cape when still west and have been

driven ashore on the African coast which

according to their reckoning lay behind

them this misfortune happened to a fine

forget the Challenger in 1845 how came

her Majesty's ship conqueror to be lost

how have so many other noble vessels

perfectly sound perfectly manned

perfectly navigated but wrecked in calm

weather not only in dark night or in a

fog but in broad daylight and sunshine

in the former case upon the coasts in

the latter upon sunken rocks from being

out of reckoning the simple answer is

that Earth is not at all thirty-nine

practical distance measurements taken

from the Australian handbook Almanac

shippers and importers directory state

took a straight line distance between

Sydney and Nelson is fifteen hundred and

fifty statute miles they're given

difference in longitude is twenty two

degrees two minutes and 14 seconds

therefore if twenty two degrees two

minutes for fourteen seconds out of 360

is fifteen hundred and fifty miles the

entirety would measure 25 thousand 182

miles this is not only larger than the

ball earth is said to be at the equator

but a whole four thousand two hundred

and sixty-two miles greater than it

would be a Sydney's southern latitude on

a globe of said proportions forty from

near Cape Horn Chile to Port Phillip at

Melbourne Australia the distance is ten

thousand five hundred miles or 143

degrees of longitude away factoring in

the remaining degrees to 360 makes for a

total distance of twenty six thousand

four hundred and thirty miles around

this particular latitude which is over a

thousand five hundred miles wider than

the earth is supposed to be at the

equator and many more thousands of miles

wider than it is supposed to be as such

southern latitudes forty one similar

calculations made from the Cape of Good

Hope South Africa to Melbourne Australia

at an average latitude of a 35.5 degrees

south have given an approximate figure

of over 25,000 miles which is again

equal to or greater than the earth

suppose at greatest circumference at the

equator calculations from Sydney

Australia to Wellington New Zealand

which of 37.5 degrees south have given

an approximate circumference of 25

thousand five hundred miles greater

still according to the baller theory the

circumference of the earth at thirty

seven point five degrees southern

latitude should be only nineteen

thousand seven hundred and fifty-seven

statute miles almost six thousand miles

less than such practical measurements 42

in the ball earth model Antarctica is an

ice continent which covers the bottom of

the ball from 78 degrees south latitude

to 90 and is therefore not more than

twelve thousand miles in circumference

many early explorers including Captain

Cook and James Clark Ross however in

attempting Antarctic circumnavigation

took three to four years and clocked

fifty to sixty thousand miles around the

British ship Challenger also made an

indirect a complete circumnavigation of

Antarctica traversing 69 thousand miles

this is entirely inconsistent with the

ball model 43 if earth was a ball there

are several flights in the southern

hemisphere which would have their

quickest straightest path over the

Antarctic continent such as Santiago

Chile to Sydney Australia instead of

taking the shortest quickest route in a

straight line over Antarctica all such

flights detour all manner of directions

away from Antarctica instead claiming

the temperatures too cold for airplane

travel considering the fact that there

are plenty of flights to/from and over

Antarctica and NASA claims to have

technology keeping them in conditions

both far colder and far hotter than any

experienced on earth such an excuse is

clearly just an excuse and these flights

aren't made because they are impossible

44 if earth was a ball and Antarctica

was too cold to fly over the only

logical way to fly from Sydney to

Santiago would be a straight shot over

the Pacific

staying in the southern hemisphere the

entire way refueling could be done in

New Zealand or other southern hemisphere

destinations along the way if absolutely

necessary

in actual fact however Santiago to

Sydney flights go into the northern

hemisphere making stopovers LAX and

other in

North American airports before

continuing back down to the southern

hemisphere such ridiculously wayward

detours make no sense on the globe but

make perfect sense and form nearly

straight lines when shown on a flat

earth map 45 on a ball earth

Johannesburg South Africa to Perth

Australia should be a straight shot over

the Indian Ocean with convenient

refueling possibilities on Meritus or

Madagascar in actual practice however

most Johannesburg to Perth flights

curiously stop over either in Dubai Hong

Kong or Malaysia all of which make no

sense on the ball but are completely

understandable when mapped on a flat

earth 46 on a ball earth Cape Town South

Africa the boy knows Aires Argentina

should be a straight shot over the

Atlantic following the same line of

latitude across but instead every flight

goes to connecting locations in the

northern hemisphere first stopping over

anywhere from London to Turkey to Dubai

once again these make absolutely no

sense on the globe but are completely

understandable options when mapped on a

flat earth 47 on a baller at the

Johannesburg South Africa to South Paulo

Brazil should be a quick straight shot

along the 25th southern latitude but

instead nearly every flight makes a

refueling stop at the 50th degree north

latitude in London first the only reason

such a ridiculous stopover works in

reality is because the earth is flat 48

on a ball earth Santiago Chile to

Johannesburg South Africa should be an

easy flight all taking place below the

Tropic of Capricorn in the southern

hemisphere yet every listed flight makes

a curious refueling stopped in Senegal

near the Tropic of Cancer in the North

hemisphere first when mapped on a flat

earth the reason why is clear to see

however Senegal is actually directly in

a straight-line path halfway between the

249 if earth were a spinning ball heated

by a Sun 93 million miles away it would

be impossible to have simultaneously

sweltering summers in Africa while just

a few thousand miles away bone-chilling

frozen Arctic and Antarctic winters

experiencing little to no heat from the

Sun whatsoever

if the heat from the Sun traveled 93

million miles to the Sahara Desert it is

absurd to assert another four thousand

miles

point zero zero zero zero four percent

further to Antarctica would completely

negate such a sweltering heat resulting

in such drastic differences 50 if the

earth were truly a globe the Arctic and

Antarctic polar regions and areas of

comparable latitude north and south of

the equator should share similar

conditions and characteristics such as

comparable temperatures seasonal changes

like the daylight plant and animal life

in reality however the Arctic and

Antarctic regions and areas of

comparable latitude north and south of

the equator differ greatly in many ways

entirely inconsistent with the ball

model an entirely consistent with the

flat model 51 Antarctica is by far the

coldest place on earth with an average

annual temperature of approximately

minus 57 degrees Fahrenheit and a record

low of minus 135 point 8 the average

annual temperature at the North Pole

however is a comparatively warm four

degrees throughout the year

temperatures in the Antarctic very less

than half the amount at comparable

Arctic latitudes the northern Arctic

region enjoys moderately warm summers

and manageable winters whereas the

southern Antarctic region never even

warms enough to melt the perpetual snow

and ice on a tilting wobbling ball earth

spinning uniformly around the Sun Arctic

and Antarctic temperatures and seasons

should not vary so greatly 52 Iceland at

65 degrees north latitude is home to 870

species of native plants and abundant

various animal life compare this with

the Isle of Georgia at just 54 degrees

south latitude where they're only 18

species of native plants and animal life

is almost non-existent the same latitude

as Canada or England in the north where

dense forests of various tall trees

abound the infamous Captain Cook wrote

of Georgia that he was unable to find a

single shrub large enough to make a

toothpick Cook wrote not a tree was to

be seen the lands which lie to the south

are due

by nature to perpetual frigid nests

never to feel the warmth of the sun's

rays whose horrible and savage aspect I

have not words to describe even marine

life is sparse in certain tracts of vast

extent and the seabird is seldom

observed flying over such lonely wastes

the contrasts between the limits of

organic life in the Arctic and Antarctic

zones is very remarkable and significant

53 at places of comparable latitude

north and south the Sun behaves very

differently than it would on a spinning

ball earth but precisely how it showed

on a flat earth for example the longest

summer days north of the Equator are

much longer than those south of the

equator and the shortest winter days

north of the Equator are much shorter

than the shortest south of the Equator

this is inexplicable on a uniformly

spinning wobbling ball earth that fits

exactly on a flat model with the Sun

traveling circles over and around the

earth from topic to topic 54 at places

of comparable latitude north and south

dawn and dusk happened very differently

than they would on a spinning ball but

precisely how they showed on a flat

earth in the North dawn and dusk come

slowly and last far longer than in the

south where they come and go very

quickly certain places in the North

Twilight can last for over an hour while

at comparable southern latitudes within

a few minutes the sunlight completely

disappears this is inexplicable on a

uniformly spinning wobbling ball earth

but is exactly what is expected on a

flat earth with the Sun traveling faster

wider circles over the south and slower

narrower circles over the north 55 if

the Sun circles over and around the

earth every 24 hours steadily traveling

from topic to topic every six months it

follows that the northern central region

would annually receive far more heat and

sunlight than the southern

circumferential region since the Sun

must sweep over the larger southern

region in the same 24 hours it has to

pass over the smaller northern region

its passage must necessarily be

proportionally faster as well this

perfectly explains the differences in

Arctic and Antarctic temperatures

seasons length of daylight plant and

animal life this is why the Antarctic

morning dawn and evening Twilight are

very abrupt compared to the

north and this explains why many

midsummer Arctic nights the Sun does not

set at all 56 the Midnight Sun is an

Arctic phenomenon occurring annually

during the summer solstice where for

several days straight an observer

significantly far enough north can watch

the Sun traveling circles overhead

rising and falling in the sky throughout

the day but never fully setting for

upwards of 72 plus hours

if the earth were actually a spinning

globe revolving around the Sun the only

place such a phenomenon as the Midnight

Sun could be observed would be at the

poles and the other advantage fight from

89 degrees latitude downwards could

never regardless of any tilt or

inclination see the Sun for 24 hours

straight to see the Sun for an entire

revolution on a spinning globe at a

point other than the poles you would

have to be looking through miles and

miles of land and sea for part of the

revolution 57 the establishment claims

the Midnight Sun is experienced in

Antarctica but they conveniently do not

have any uncut videos showing this nor

do they allow independent explorers to

travel to Antarctica during the winter

solstice to verify or refute these

claims conversely there are dozens of

uncut videos publicly available showing

the Arctic Midnight Sun and it has been

verified beyond any shadow of a doubt 58

the Royal Belgian geographical society

in their expedition antarctic bells

recorded that during the most severe

part of the Antarctic winter from 71

degrees south latitude onwards the Sun

sets on May 17th and is not seen above

the horizon again until July 21st this

is completely at odds with the baller

theory but easily explained by the Flat

Earth model the Midnight Sun is seen

from high altitudes in extreme northern

latitudes during Arctic summer because

the Sun and its innermost cycle is

circling tightly enough around the polar

centre that it remains visible above the

horizon for someone at such a vantage

point

likewise in extreme southern latitudes

during Arctic summer the Sun completely

disappears from view for over two months

because there at the northern Tropic the

innermost arc of its boomerang journey

the Sun is circling the northern centre

too tightly to be seen from the southern

circumference

59 quoting gabrielle Henriette the

theory of the rotation of the earth may

once and for all be definitely disposed

of as impracticable by pointing out the

following inadvertence it is said that

the rotation takes 24 hours and that its

speed is uniform in which case

necessarily days and nights should have

an identical duration of 12 hours each

all the year round the Sun should

invariably rise in the morning and set

in the evening at the same hours with

the result that it would be the equinox

every day from the 1st of January to the

31st of December one should stop and

reflect on this before saying that the

earth has a movement of rotation how

does the system of gravitation account

for the seasonal variations in the

length of days and nights if the earth

rotates at a uniform speed in 24 hours

16 anyone can prove the sea horizon

perfectly straight in the earth

perfectly flat using nothing more than a

level tripods and a wooden plank at any

altitude above sea level simply fix a 6

to 12 foot long smooth levelled board

and tries upon tripods and observe the

skyline from eye level behind it the

distant horizon will always appear

perfectly level with the upper edge of

the board furthermore if you move in a

half circle from one end of the board to

the other whilst observing the skyline

over the upper edge you'll be able to

trace a clear flat 10 to 20 miles

depending on your altitude this would be

impossible of the earthwork globe 25,000

miles in circumference the horizon would

align over the center of the board then

gradually noticeably decline towards the

extremities just 10 miles on each side

would necessitate an easily visible

curvature of 66.6 feet from each end to

the center 61 if the earth were actually

a big ball 25,000 miles in circumference

the horizon would be noticeably curved

even at sea level and everything on or

approaching the horizon would appear to

tilt backwards slightly from your

perspective distant buildings along the

horizon would all look like leaning

towers of Pisa falling away from the

observer a hot-air balloon

taking off then drifting steadily away

from you on a ball earth when slowly and

constantly appear to lean back more

more the farther away of flu the bottom

of the basket coming gradually into view

as the top of the balloon disappears

from sight in reality however buildings

balloons trees people anything and

everything at right angles to the ground

and horizon remain so regardless the

distance or height of the observer 62

Samuel Rowbotham experiments at the Old

Bedford level proved conclusively the

canals water to be completely flat over

a six mile stretch first he stood in the

canal with his telescope held eight

inches above the surface of the water

then his friend in a boat with a

five-foot tall flag sailed the six miles

away if earth were a ball 25,000 miles

in circumference the six mile stretch of

water should have comprised an arc

exactly six feet high in the middle so

the entire boat and flag should have

ultimately disappeared when in fact the

entire boat and flag remained visible at

the same height for the entire journey

63 in a second experiment dr. Rowbotham

affixed flags five feet high along the

shoreline one at every mile marker then

using his telescope mounted at five feet

just behind the first flag looked over

the tops of all six flags which lined up

in a perfectly straight line if the

earth were a ball 25,000 miles in

circumference

the flags should have progressively

dipped down after the first establishing

line of sight the second would have

descended eight inches 32 inches for the

third six feet for the fourth 10 feet

eight inches for the fifth and sixteen

feet eight inches for the six sixty four

quoting earth not a globe by Samuel

Rowbotham it is known that the horizon

at sea whatever distance it may extend

to the right and left of the observer on

land always appears as a straight line

the following experiment has been tried

in various parts of the country at

Brighton on a rising ground near the

racecourse two poles who are fixed in

the earth six yards apart and directly

opposite the sea between these poles a

line was tightly stretched parallel to

the horizon from the center of the line

the view embraced not less than 20 miles

on each side making a distance of 40

miles a vessel was observed sailing

directly westwards the line cut the

rigging a little above the bulwarks

did for several hours or until the

vessel had sailed the whole distance of

40 miles the ship coming into view from

the east would have to ascend an

inclined plane for 20 miles until it

arrived at the center of the arc once it

would have to descend for the same

distance the square of 20 miles

multiplied by 8 inches gives 266 feet as

the amount the vessel would be below the

line at the beginning and at the end of

the 40 miles 65 also quoting dr.

Rowbotham on a shore near Waterloo a few

miles to the north of Liverpool a good

telescope was fixed at an elevation of 6

feet above the water it was directed to

a large steamer just leaving the River

Mersey and sailing out to Dublin

gradually the masthead of the receding

vessel came near to the horizon until at

length after more than four hours had

elapsed it disappeared the ordinary mate

of sailing of the Dublin steamers was

fully 8 miles an hour so that the vessel

would be at least 32 miles distant when

the masthead came to the horizon the six

feet of elevation of the telescope would

require three miles to meet deducted for

convexity which would leave 29 miles the

square of which multiplied by 8 inches

gives 560 feet deducting 80 feet for the

height of the main mast and we find that

according to the doctrine of fraternity

the masthead of the outward-bound

steamer should have been 480 feet below

the horizon many other experiments of

this kind have been made upon seagoing

steamers and always with the results

entirely incompatible with the theory

that the earth is a globe 66 dr.

Rowbotham conducted several other

experiments using telescopes spirit

levels sextants and theodolites special

precision instruments used for measuring

angles and horizontal or vertical planes

by positioning them an equal Heights

aimed at each other successively he

proved over and over the earth to be

perfectly flat for miles without a

single inch of curvature his findings

caused quite a stir in the scientific

community and thanks to 30 years of his

efforts the shape of the earth became a

hot topic of debate around the turn of

the 19th century

67 the distance across the Irish Sea

from the isle of man's douglas harbour

two great arms head in north wales at

sixty miles if the earth was a globe

then the surface of the water between

them would form a 60 mile arc centre

towering nineteen hundred and forty four

feet higher than the coastlines at

either end it is well known and easily

verifiable however but on a clear day

from a modest altitude of a hundred feet

the great arms head is visible from

douglas harbour this would be completely

impossible on a globe of 25,000 miles

assuming 100 foot altitude causes the

horizon to appear approximately 13 miles

off the 47 miles remaining means the

Welsh coastline should still fall an

impossible fourteen hundred and seventy

two feet below the line of sight 68 the

Philadelphia skyline is clearly visible

from apple-pie Hill in the New Jersey

Pine Barrens 40 miles away if earth were

about 25 thousand miles in circumference

factoring in the 205 foot elevation of

apple-pie Hill the Philly skyline should

remain well hidden beyond three hundred

and thirty five feet of curvature 60 net

the New York City skyline is clearly

visible from Harriman state parks Bear

New York City skyline should be

Washington's Rock in New Jersey at just

a 400 foot elevation it is possible on a

clear day to see the skylines of both

New York and Philadelphia in opposite

directions at the same time covering a

total distance of 120 miles if earth

were about 25 thousand miles in

circumference

both of these skylines should be hidden

behind over 800 feet of Earth's

curvature 71 it is often possible to see

the Chicago skyline from sea level 60

miles away across Lake Michigan in 2015

after photographer Joshua nawicki

photographed this phenomena

several news channels quickly claimed

his picture to be a superior Mirage an

atmospheric anomaly caused by

temperature inversion while these

certainly do occur the skyline in

question was facing right-side up and

clearly seen unlike a hazy illusory

Mirage and on a ball earth 25,000 miles

in circumference should be 2,400 feet

below the horizon 72 October 16th 1854

The Times newspaper reported the Queen's

visit to great Grimsby from Hull

recording they were able to see the 300

foot tall dock tower from 70 miles away

on a ball worth twenty five thousand

miles in circumference

factoring their 10-foot elevation above

the water and the towers 300 foot height

at 70 miles away the doctor should have

remained an entire 2600 feet below the

horizon 73 in 1872 captain Gibson and

crewmates sailing the ship

Thomas wood from China to London

reported seeing the entirety of st.

Helena Island on a clear day from 75

miles away

factoring in their height during

measurement on a ball earth 25,000 miles

in circumference it was found the island

should have been three thousand six

hundred and fifty feet below their line

of sight 74 from Genoa Italy at a height

of just 70 feet above sea level the

island of Gorgona can often be seen 81

miles away if earth were ball 25,000

miles in circumference Gorgona

should be hidden beyond 3332 feet of

curvature 75 from genoa italy at a

height of just 70 feet above sea level

the island of Corsica can often be seen

99 miles away if earth were about

twenty-five thousand miles in

circumference

Corsica should fall five thousand two

hundred and forty-five feet almost an

entire mile below the horizon 76 from

Genoa Italy 70 feet above sea level the

island of Capri ax 102 miles away can

often be seen as well if earth were

about 25 thousand miles in circumference

cap Reyes should always remain hidden

behind 5,000

605 feet over a mile of supposed

curvature 77 also from Genoa on bright

clear days the island of elba can be

seen an incredible 125 miles away if

earth were a ball 25,000 miles in

circumference

Elba should be forever invisible behind

eight thousand seven hundred and seventy

feet of curvature 78 from Anchorage

Alaska at an elevation of 102 feet on

clear days mount Foraker can be seen

with the naked eye 120 miles away if

earth were a ball 25,000 miles in

can be quite easily seen standing

straight from base to summit 80 in

chambers journal February 1895 a sailor

near Meritus in the Indian Ocean

reported having seen a vessel which

turned out to be an incredible 200 miles

away the incident caused much heated

debate in nautical circles at the time

gaining further confirmation in Aden

Yemen where another witness reported

seeing a missing Bombay steamer from 200

miles away he correctly stated the

precise appearance location and

direction of the steamer all later

corroborated and confirmed correct by

those on board such sightings are

absolutely inexplicable if the earth

were actually a ball 25,000 miles around

as ships 200 miles distant would have to

fall approximately five miles below

line-of-sight 81

the distance from which various

lighthouse lights around the world are

visible at sea far exceeds what could be

found on a ball earth 25,000 miles in

circumference

for example the Dunkirk light in

southern France at an altitude of 194

feet is visible from a boat 10 feet

above sea level 28 miles away spiracle

trigonometry dictates that if the earth

was a globe with the given curvature of

eight inches per mile squared this light

should be hidden 190 feet below the

horizon 82 the Port Nicholson light in

New Zealand is 420 feet above sea level

and visible from 35 miles away where it

should be

220 feet below the horizon 83 the ocurro

light in Norway is 154 feet above

high-water and visible from 28 statute

miles where it should be 230 feet below

the horizon 84 the light at Madras on

the Esplanade is 132 feet high and

visible from 28 miles away where it

should be 250 feet below the line of

sight 85 the cordon and light on the

west coast of France is 207 feet high

and visible from 31 miles away where it

should be 280 feet below the line of

sight 86 the light at Cape Bonavista

Newfoundland is 150 feet above sea level

and visible at 35 miles where it should

be 491 feet below the horizon 87 the

lighthouse steeple of st. bole tops

parish church in Boston is 290 feet tall

and visible from over 40 miles away

where it should be hidden a full 800

feet below the horizon 88 the Isle of

Wight lighthouse in England is 180 feet

high and we can be seen up to 42 miles

away a distance at which modern

astronomers say the light should fall

996 feet below the line of sight 89 the

Cape Lagoo last lighthouse in South

Africa is 33 feet high 238 feet above

sea level and can be seen for over 50

miles

if the world work globe this light would

fall 1,400 feet below an observers

line-of-sight 90 the Statue of Liberty

in New York stands 326 feet above sea

level and on a clear day can be seen as

far as sixty miles away

if the earth were a globe that would put

Lady Liberty at an impossible two

thousand seventy four feet below the

horizon ninety one the lighthouse at

Port Syed Egypt at an elevation of only

sixty feet has been seen an astonishing

58 miles away where according to modern

astronomy it should be two thousand one

hundred and eighty-two feet below the

line of sight ninety two the notre-dame

antwerp spire stands 403 feet high from

the foot of the tower with strasbourg

measuring four hundred and sixty eight

feet above sea level with the aid of a

telescope ships can be distinguished on

the horizon and captains declare they

can see the cathedral spire from an

amazing hundred and fifty miles away

if the earth were our globe however at

that distance the spire should be an

entire mile 5,280 feet below the horizon

ninety three the st. George's channel

between Holyhead and Kingston Harbor

near Dublin is sixty miles across when

half way across a ferry passenger will

notice behind them the light on Holyhead

Pier as well as in front of them the

pool bag light in Dublin Bay the holy

head pier light is 44 feet high while

the pool peg lighthouse 68 feet

therefore a vessel in the middle of the

channel 30 miles from either side

standing on a deck 24 feet above the

water can clearly see both lights on a

ball earth 25,000 miles in circumference

however both lights should be hidden

well below both horizons by over 300

feet 94 from the high land near

Portsmouth Harbour in Hampshire England

looking across Spithead to the Isle of

Wight the entire base of the island

where water and land come together

composes a perfectly straight line 22

statute miles long according to the

baller theory the Isle of Wight decline

80 feet from the centre on each side to

account for the necessary curvature the

crosshairs of a good theatre light

directed there

have repeatedly shown the land and water

line to be perfectly level 95 on a clear

day from the high head near Douglas

harbor on the Isle of Man the whole

length of the coast of North Wales is

often plainly visible to the naked eye

from the point of air at the mouth of

the River d2 holy head comprises a

50-mile stretch which has also been

repeatedly found to be perfectly

horizontal if the earth actually had

curvature of eight inches per mile

squared as NASA and modern astronomy

claimed the 50-mile length of Welsh

Coast seen along the horizon in

Liverpool Bay would have to decline from

the center point an easily detectable

416 feet on each side 96 from 100 proofs

the earth is not a globe by William

carpenter if we take the journey down

chesapeake bay by night we shall see the

light exhibited at sharps island for an

hour before the steamer gets to it we

may take up a position on deck so that

the rail of the vessel side will be in a

line with the light and in the line of

sight and we shall find that in the

whole journey the light won't vary in

the slightest degree in its apparent

elevation but say that a distance of 13

miles has been traversed the astronomers

theory of curvature demands a difference

one way or the other in the apparent

elevation of the light of 112 feet 8

inches since however there is not a

difference of 100 hairs and breaths we

have a plain proof that the water of the

Chesapeake Bay is not curved which is a

proof that the earth is not a globe 97

NASA and modern astronomy say the earth

is a giant ball tilted back wobbling and

spinning 1,000 miles per hour around its

central axis traveling 67,000 miles per

hour circles around the Sun spiraling

500,000 miles per hour around the Milky

Way while the entire galaxy Rockets are

ridiculous 670 million miles through the

universe with all of these motions

originating from an alleged big bang

cosmic explosion 14 billion years ago

that's a grand total of 67 million five

hundred and sixty eight thousand miles

per hour in several different directions

we're all supposedly speeding along at

simultaneously yet no one has ever seen

felt heard measured or proven a single

one of these motions to exist whatsoever

98 NASA and modern astronomy say Polaris

the North Pole star is somewhere between

323 and 434 light-years or about two

quadrillion miles away from us firstly

note that is between 1 quadrillion 938

trillion 2 to quadrillions 604 trillion

miles making a difference of over 600

trillion miles if modern astronomy

cannot even agree on the distance to

stars within hundreds of trillions of

miles perhaps their science is flawed

and their theory needs re-examining

however even granting them their

obscurely distant stars it is impossible

for heliocentric to explain how Polaris

manages to always remain perfectly

aligned straight above the North Pole

throughout Earth's various alleged

tilting wobbling rotating and revolving

motions 99 viewed from a baller Polaris

situated directly over the North Pole

should not be visible anywhere in the

southern hemisphere for Polaris to be

seen from the southern hemisphere of a

globular Earth the observer would have

to be somehow looking through the globe

and miles of land and sea would have to

be transparent

Polaris can be seen however up to over

20 degrees south latitude 100 if Earth

were a ball the Southern Cross and other

southern constellations would all be

visible at the same time from every

longitude on the same latitude as is the

case in the north with Polaris and its

surrounding constellations or some major

and minor and many others can be seen

from every northern meridian

simultaneously whereas in the South

constellations like the Southern Cross

cannot this proves that the southern

hemisphere is not turned under as in the

ball model but simply stretching further

outwards away from the northern center

point as in the Flat Earth model 101

Sigma act entus is claimed to be a

southern central pole star similar to

Polaris around which the southern

hemisphere stars all rotate around the

opposite direction

unlike Polaris however Sigma Act entus

cannot be seen simultaneously from every

point along the same line

attitude it is not central but allegedly

one degree off center it is not

motionless and in fact cannot be seen at

all using publicly available telescopes

there's legitimate speculation regarding

whether Sigma Act antis even exists

either way the direction in which stars

move overhead is based on perspective in

the exact direction you're facing not

which hemisphere you're in 102 some

heliocentric have tried to suggest that

the pole stars gradual declination

overhead as an observer travels

southward is proved of a globular far

ferment the declination of the pole star

or any other object is simply a result

of the law of perspective on plain flat

surfaces the law of perspective dictates

that the angle and height at which an

object is seen diminishes the farther

one recedes from the object until at a

certain point the line of sight and the

seemingly Uprising surface of the earth

converges to a vanishing point ie the

horizon line beyond which the object is

invisible in the ball earth model the

horizon is claimed to be the curvature

of the earth whereas in reality the

horizon is known to simply be the

vanishing line of perspective based on

the strength of your eyes instruments

weather and altitude 103 there are

several constellations which can be seen

from far greater distances over the face

of the earth

then should be possible if the world

were rotating revolving wobbling ball

for instance Ursa Major very close to

Polaris can be seen from 90 degrees

north latitude the North Pole all the

way down to 30 degrees south latitude

for this to be possible on a ball earth

the southern observers would have to be

seen through hundreds or thousands of

miles of bulging earth to the northern

sky 104 the constellation of vulpecula

can be seen from 90 degrees north

latitude all the way to 55 degrees south

latitude Taurus Pisces and Leo can be

seen from 90 degrees north all the way

to 65 degrees cell and observer on a

ball earth regardless of any tilt or

inclination should not logically be able

to see this bar 105 Aquarius and Libra

can be seen from 65 degrees north to 90

degrees cell the constellation Virgo is

visible from 80 degrees north

to 80 degrees south then Orien can be

seen from 85 degrees north all the way

to 75 degrees south latitude these are

all only possible because the

hemispheres are not spheres at all but

concentric circles of latitude extending

outwards from the central North Pole

with the Stars rotating over and around

106 the so-called South Pole is simply

an arbitrary point along the Antarctic

ice marked with a red and white

barbershop pole topped to the middle

baller the ceremonial self coal is

admittedly and provably not the actual

South Pole however because the actual

South Pole could be demonstrably

confirmed with the aid of a compass

showing North to be 360 degrees around

the observer since this feat has never

been achieved the model remains pure

theory along with the establishments

excuse that the geomagnetic poles

supposedly constantly move around making

verifications of their claims impossible

107 ring magnets of the kind found in

loudspeakers have a central North Pole

with the opposite South Pole actually

being all points along the outer

circumference this perfectly

demonstrates the magnetism of our Flat

Earth whereas the alleged source of

magnetism in the ball earth model is

emitted from a hypothetical molten

magnetic core in the center of the ball

which they claim conveniently causes

both poles to constantly move thus

evading independent verification at

their two ceremonial poles in reality

the deepest drilling operation in

history the Russian Kola ultra deep

managed to get only eight miles down so

the entire ball earth model Totten

schools showing a crust outer mantle

inner mantle outer core and inner core

layers are all purely speculation as we

have never penetrated through beyond the

crust 108 the Mariners compass is an

impossible and nonsensical instrument

for use on a ball earth that

simultaneously points north and south

over a flat surface yet claims to be

pinpointing - constantly moving

geomagnetic poles at opposite ends of a

spinning sphere originating from a

hypothetical molten metal core if

compass needles were actually drawn to

the north pole of a globe the opposing

self needle would actually be pointing

up and off into outer space

109 there are no fixed east or west

points just as there's no fixed south

the north central pole is the only

proven fixed point on our Flat Earth

with South being all straight lines

outwards from the pole east and west

being concentric circles at constant

right angles 90 degrees from the bowl

a westerly circumnavigation of Earth is

thus going around with Polaris

continually on your right while an

easterly circumnavigation is going

around with Polaris always at your left

110 Magellan and others east-west

circumnavigations of Earth are often

quoted as proof of the ball model in

actual fact however sailing or flying at

right angles to the North Pole and

eventually returning to one's original

location is no more difficult or

mysterious than doing so on a globe just

as an architect's compass can place its

center point on a flat piece of paper

and trace a circle either way around the

pole

so can a ship or plane circumnavigate a

flat earth 111 since the North Pole in

Antarctica are covered in ice and

guarded no-fly zones no ships or planes

have ever been known to circumnavigate

the earth in north-south directions the

only kind of circumnavigation which

could not happen on a flat earth is

north and southbound which is likely the

very reason for the heavily enforced

flight restrictions the fact that there

is yet to be a single verified North to

South circumnavigation of Earth serves

as standing proof the world is not all

112 the Sun brings Newton to every time

zone as it passes directly overhead

every 15 degree demarcation point 24

times per day in its circular path over

and around the earth if time zones were

instead caused by the uniform spinning

of the ball earth around the Sun every

six months as Earth found itself on the

opposite side of the Sun clocks all over

Earth would have to flip twelve hours

day would be night and night would be

day 113 the idea that people are

standing ships are sailing and planes

are flying upside down on certain parts

of Earth while others tilted at 90

degrees and all other impossible angles

is complete absurdity the idea that a

man digging a hole straight down could

eventually reach sky

on the other side is ludicrous common

sense tells every free thinking person

correctly that there truly is an up and

down in nature unlike the everything is

relative rhetoric of the Newtonian

einsteinium paradigm 114 quoting on the

false wisdom of the philosophers bilah

conscience a sphere where people on the

other side lived with their feet above

their heads where rain snow and hail

fall upwards where trees and crops grow

upside down and the sky is lower than

the ground the ancient wonder of the

Hanging Gardens of Babylon dwindle into

nothing in comparison to the fields seas

towns and mountains that pagan

philosophers believed to be hanging from

the earth without support 115 the

existing laws of density and buoyancy

perfectly explained the physics of

falling objects long before knighted

freemasons Sir Isaac Newton bestowed his

theory of gravity upon the world it is a

fact that objects placed in denser

mediums arise up while objects place in

less dense mediums sink down to fit with

the heliocentric model which has no up

or down

Newton instead claimed objects are

attracted to large masses and fall

towards the center not a single

experiment in history however has shown

an object a massive enough to by virtue

of its mass alone cause other smaller

masses to be attracted to it as Newton

claims gravity does with the earth the

Sun Moon stars and planets 116 there is

also never been a single experiment in

history showing an object massive enough

to by virtue of its mass alone cause

another smaller mass to orbit around it

the magic theory of gravity allows for

oceans buildings and people to remain

forever stuck to the underside of a

spinning ball while simultaneously

causing objects like the moon and

satellites to remain locked in perpetual

circular orbits around the earth if

these were both true then people should

be able to jump up and start orbiting

circles around the Earth or the moon

should've long ago been sucked into the

earth neither of these theories have

ever been experimentally verified and

their alleged results are mutually

exclusive

117

Newton also theorized and it is now

commonly taught that the Earth's ocean

tides are caused by gravitational lunar

Attraction if the moon is only 2160

miles in diameter and the earth eight

thousand miles

however using their own math and law it

follows that the earth is 87 times more

massive and therefore the larger object

should attract the smaller to it and not

the other way around if the Earth's

greater gravity is what keeps the moon

in orbit it is impossible for the moon's

and lesser gravity to supersede the

Earth's gravity especially at Earth's

sea level or its gravitational

attraction would even further out trump

the moon's and if the moon's gravity

truly didn't supersede the earth is

causing the tides to be drawn towards it

there should be nothing to stop them

from continuing onwards and upwards

towards their Great Attractor 118

furthermore the velocity and path of the

moon are uniform and should therefore

exist a uniform influence on the Earth's

time when in actuality Earth's tides

vary greatly and do not follow the moon

Earth's lakes ponds marshes and other

inland bodies of water also inexplicably

remain forever outside the moon's

gravitational grasp if gravity was truly

drawing Earth's oceans up to it all

lakes ponds and other bodies of standing

water should certainly have tides as

well 118 it has claimed the other

planets are spheres and so therefore

Earth must also be a sphere firstly

earth is a plane not a planet so the

shape of these planets in the sky have

no bearing on the shape of the earth

beneath our feet secondly these planets

have been known for thousands of years

around the world as wandering stars

since they differ from the other fixed

stars in their relative motions only

when looked at with an unprejudiced

naked eye or through a telescope the

fixed and wandering stars appear as

luminous disks of light not spherical

terra firma the pictures and videos

shown by NASA of spherical Terra Firma

planets are all clearly fake

computer-generated images and not

photographs 120 the etymology of the

word planet actually comes from the late

old english planet or from old french

planet from latin Planeta from greek

planet

Planet Thai wandering stars or to wander

of unknown origin to spread or notion of

spread out from Latin plenum flat

surface plain level plane they just

added a tea to our earth plane and

everyone bought it

121 when you observed the Sun and Moon

you see two equally sized equidistant

circles tracing similar paths at similar

speeds around a flat stationary earth

the experts at NASA however claim your

common sense everyday experiences false

on all counts to begin with they say the

earth is not flat but a big ball not

stationary but spinning around 19 miles

per second they say the Sun does not

revolve around the earth as it appears

but Earth revolves around the Sun the

moon on the other hand does revolve

around the earth though not east to west

as it appears rather west to east and

the Sun is actually four hundred times

larger than the moon and 400 times

farther away you can clearly see they

are the same size and distance you can

see there at this flat you can feel the

earth is stationary but according to the

Gospel of modern astronomy you are wrong

in a simpleton worthy of endless

ridicule if you dare to trust your own

eyes and experience 122 quoting Allen

Dame's if the government or NASA had

said to you that the earth is stationary

imagine that and then imagine we are

trying to convince people that no no

it's not stationary it's moving forward

at 32 times rifle bullet speed and

spinning at a thousand miles per hour we

would be laughed at

we would have so many people telling us

you're crazy the Earth's not moving we

would be ridiculed for having no

scientific backing for this convoluted

moving earth theory and not only that

but then people would say oh then how do

you explain a fixed calm atmosphere in

the sun's observable movement how do you

explain that imagine saying to people no

no the atmosphere is moving also but is

somehow magically velcroed to the moving

earth the reason is not simply because

the earth is stationary so what we are

actually doing is what makes sense we

are saying that the moving earth theory

is nonsense

the stationary earth theory makes sense

and we are being ridiculed we've got to

picture it being the other way around to

realize just how ridiculous the

situation is this theory from the

government and mass

that the earth is rotating and orbiting

and leaning over and wobbling is

absolute nonsense and yet people are

clinging to it tightly like a teddy bear

they just can't bring themselves to face

the possibility that the earth is

stationary though all evidence shows it

we feel no movement the atmosphere

hasn't been blown away we see the Sun

move from east to west everything can be

explained by a motionless earth without

bringing in all these assumptions to

cover our previous assumptions gone bad

123 Helio centrists astronomical figures

always sound perfectly precise but they

have historically been notorious for

regularly and drastically changing them

to suit their various models for

instance in his time Copernicus

calculated the sun's distance from Earth

to be 3 million 391 200 miles the next

century Johannes Kepler decided it was

actually 12 million three hundred and

seventy six thousand eight hundred miles

away Isaac Newton once said it matters

not whether we reckon at 28 or 54

million miles distant for either would

do just as well how scientific Benjamin

Martin calculated between 81 and 82

million miles Thomas Dilworth claimed 93

million seven hundred and twenty-six

thousand nine hundred miles John Heinz

stated positively ninety-five million

two hundred and ninety eight thousand

two hundred and sixty miles

Benjamin Gould said more than 96 million

miles and Christian mayor thought it was

more than 104 million flat-earthers

throughout the ages conversely have used

sextant sand plane trigonometry to make

such calculations and found the Sun and

the moon both to be only about 32 miles

in diameter and less than a few thousand

miles from Earth 124 amateur balloon

footage taken above the clouds has

provided stunning visual proof that the

Sun cannot be millions of miles away in

several shots you can see a clear hot

spot reflecting on the clouds directly

below the Sun spotlight like influence

if the Sun were actually millions of

miles away such a small localized hot

spot could not occur 125 another proof

the Sun is not millions of miles away is

found by tracing the angle of sunrays

back to their source above the clouds

there are thousands of pictures showing

how sunlight comes down through cloud

cover at a variance of converging angles

the area of convergence is of course the

Sun and is not millions of miles away

but rather relatively close to earth

just above the clouds 126 the sun's

annual journey from topic to topic

solstice to solstice is what determines

the length and character of days nights

and seasons this is why equatorial

regions experience almost year-round

summer and heat while higher latitudes

north and especially south experienced

more distinct seasons with harsh winters

the heliocentric model claims seasons

change based on the ball earth's alleged

axial tilt and elliptical orbit around

the Sun yet they're flawed current model

places us closest to the Sun 91 million

miles in January when it is actually

winter and farthest from the Sun ninety

four point five million miles in July

when it's actually summer throughout

most of the earth 127 the fact that the

Sun and moons reflections on water

always form a straight-line path from

the horizon to the observer proves the

earth is none of all if the Earth's

surface was curved it would be

impossible for the reflected light to

curve over the ball from Horizon to

observer 128 there are huge

centuries-old Stone sundials and moon

dials all over the world which still

tell the time now down to the minute as

perfectly as the day they were made if

the Earth Sun and Moon were truly

subject to the number of contradictory

revolving rotating wobbling and

spiraling motions claimed by modern

astronomy it would be impossible for

these monuments to so accurately tell

time without constant adjustment 129 to

quote William carpenter why in the name

of common sense should observers have to

fix their telescopes on solid stone

bases so that they should not move a

hair's breadth if the earth on which

they fix them moves at the rate of 19

miles in a second indeed to believe that

6000 million million million tons is

rolling searching flying darting on

through space forever with a velocity

compared with which a shot from a cannon

is a very slow coach with such unerring

accuracy that a telescope fixed

granite pillars in an observatory will

not enable a link side astronomer to

detect a variation in its onward motion

of the thousandth part of a hair's

breadth is to conceive a miracle

compared with which all the miracles on

record put together would sink into

utter insignificance since we can in

middle North latitudes see the North

Star on looking out of a window that

faces it and out of this very same

corner of the very same pane of glass in

the very same window all the year round

it is proof enough for any man in his

senses that we have not made any motion

at all and that the earth is not a globe

130 from Earth not a globe by a Samuel

Rowbotham take to carefully board

metallic tubes not less than 6 feet in

length and placed them one yard asunder

on the opposite sides of a wooden frame

or a solid block of wood or stone so

adjust them at their centres or axes of

vision shall be perfectly parallel to

each other now direct them to the plane

of some notable fixed star a few seconds

previous to its Meridian time let an

observer be stationed at each tube in

the moment the star appears in the first

tube that a loud knock or other signal

be given to be repeated by the observer

at the second tube when he sees the same

star

a distinct period of time will elapse

between the signals given the signals

will follow each other in a very rapid

succession but still the time between is

sufficient to show that the same star is

not visible at the same moment by two

parallel lines of sight when only one

yard is under a slight inclination of

the second tube towards the first to

would be required for the star to be

seen through both tubes at the same

instant but the tubes remain in their

positions for six months at the end of

which time the same observation or

experiment will produce the same results

the star will be visible at the same

meridian time without the slightest

alteration being required in the

direction of the tubes from which it is

concluded that if the earth had moved

one single yard in an orbit through

space there would at least be observed

the slight inclination of the tube which

the difference in position of one yard

had previously required but has no such

difference in the direction of the tube

is required the

conclusion is unavoidable than in six

months a given Meridian upon the Earth's

surface does not move a single yard and

therefore that the earth has not the

slightest degree of orbital motion 131

NASA and modern astronomy maintained

that the moon is a solid spherical

earth-like habitation which man has

actually flown to and set foot on they

claim the moon as a non luminescent

planetoid which receives and reflects

all its light from the Sun the reality

is however that the moon is observably

not a solid body it is clearly circular

but not spherical and not in any way an

earth-like planet oi which humans could

set foot on in fact the moon has been

proven largely transparent and

completely self luminescent shining with

its own unique light 132 the sun's light

is golden warm drying preservative and

antiseptic while the moon's light is

silver cool damp purifying and septic

the sun's rays decrease the combustion

of a bonfire while the moon's rays

increased combustion plant and animal

substances exposed to sunlight quickly

dry shrink coagulate and lose the

tendency to decompose and purify grapes

and other fruits become solid partially

candied and preserved like raisins dates

and prunes animal flesh coagulates loses

its volatile gaseous constituents

becomes firm dry and slow to decay when

exposed to moonlight however plant and

animal substances tend to show symptoms

of putrefaction and decay

this proves that Sun and moonlight are

different unique and opposites as they

are in the geocentric flat mode 133 in

direct sunlight a thermometer will read

higher than another thermometer placed

in the shade but in full direct

moonlight a thermometer will read lower

than another place than the shade if the

sun's light is collected in a large lens

and thrown to a focus point it can

create significant heat while the moon's

light collected similarly creates no

heat in The Lancet medical journal from

March 14 1856 particulars are given of

several experiments which prove the

moon's rays when concentrated can

actually reduce the temperature upon a

thermometer more than eight degrees so

sunlight and moonlight clearly have

altogether different property

134 furthermore the moon itself cannot

physically be both a spherical body and

a reflector of the sun's light

reflectors must be flat or concave for

light rays to have any angle of

incidence if a reflectors surface is

convex than every ray of light points in

a direct line with the radius

perpendicular to the surface resulting

in no reflection 135 not only is the

moon clearly self luminescent shining

its own unique light but it is also

largely transparent when the waxing or

waning moon is visible during the day it

is possible to see the blue sky right

through the moon and on a clear night

during a waxing or waning cycle is even

possible to occasionally see stars and

planets directly through the surface of

the Moon the Royal Astronomical Society

has on record many such occurrences

throughout history which all defied the

heliocentric model 136 many people think

that modern astronomy z' ability to

accurately predict lunar and solar

eclipses as a result and proof positive

of the heliocentric theory of the

universe the fact of the matter however

is that eclipses have been accurately

predicted by cultures worldwide for

thousands of years before the

heliocentric ball earth was even a

glimmer and Copernicus's imagination

Ptolemy in the 1st century AD accurately

predicted eclipses for 600 years on the

basis of a flat stationary earth with

equal position as anyone living today

all the way back in 600 BC say Lee's

accurately predicted an eclipse which

ended the war between the Medes and the

Lydians

eclipses happen regularly with precision

in eighteen-year cycles so regardless of

geocentric or heliocentric flat or globe

earth cosmologies eclipses can be

accurately calculated independent of

such factors 137 another assumption and

supposed proof of the Earth's shape

heliocentric lame that lunar eclipses

are caused by the shadow of the ball

earth occulting the moon they claim the

Sun Earth and Moon spheres perfectly

aligned like three billiard balls in a

row so that the sun's light casts the

Earth's shadow onto the moon

unfortunately for heliocentric this

explanation is rendered completely

invalid due to the fact that lunar

eclipses have happened and continue to

happen

when both Sun and Moon are still visible

together above the horizon for the sun's

light to be casting earth's shadow onto

the moon the three bodies must be

aligned in a straight hundred and eighty

degrees syzygy but as early as the time

of Pliny

there are records of lunar eclipses

happening while both the Sun and Moon

are visible in the sky

therefore the eclipse of the Moon cannot

be the earth or Earth's shadow and some

other explanation must be sought 138

another favorite proof of Baal Arthur's

is the appearance from an observer on

shore of ships hulls being unfitted by

the water and disappearing from view

when sailing away towards the horizon

their claim is that ships hulls

disappear before their mastheads

because this ship is beginning its

declination around the convex curvature

of the ball earth once again however

their hasty conclusion is drawn from a

faulty premise mainly that only on a

ball earth could this phenomenon occur

the fact of the matter is that the law

of perspective on plane surfaces

dictates and necessitates the exact same

occurrence for example a girl wearing a

dress walking away towards the horizon

will appear to sink into the earth the

farther away she walks her feet will

disappear from view first and the

distance between the ground and the

bottom of her dress will gradually

diminish until after a half a mile it

seems like her dress is touching the

ground as she walks on invisible legs

such as the caisson plane surfaces the

lowest parts of objects receiving from a

given point of observation necessarily

disappear before the highest 139 not

only is the disappearance of ships hulls

explained by the law of perspective on

flat surfaces it is proven undeniably

true with the aid of a good telescope if

he watch a ship sailing away into the

horizon with the naked eye until its

hull has completely disappeared from

view under the supposed curvature of the

earth then look through a telescope you

will notice the entire ship quickly

zooms back into view hull and all

proving that the disappearance was

caused by the law of perspective not by

a wall of curved water this also proves

that the horizon is simply the vanishing

line of perspective from your point of

view not the alleged curvature of the

earth

144 cult's pendulums are often quoted as

proof of a rote

but upon closer investigation proved the

opposite to begin with Foucault pendulum

is do not uniformly swing in any one

direction sometimes they rotate

clockwise and sometimes counterclockwise

sometimes they fail to rotate and

sometimes they rotate far too much the

behavior of the pendulum actually

depends on one the initial force

beginning its swing and to the

ball-and-socket joint which most readily

facilitates circular motion over any

other the supposed rotation of the earth

is completely inconsequential and

irrelevant to the pendulum swing if the

alleged constant rotation of the earth

affected pendulums in any way then there

should be no need to manually start

pendulums in motion if the Earth's

diurnal rotation caused the 360 degree

uniform diurnal rotation of pendulums

then there should not exist a stationary

pendulum anywhere on earth 141 the

Coriolis effect is often said to cause

sinks and toilet bowls in the northern

hemisphere to drain spinning in one

direction while in the southern

hemisphere causing them to spin the

opposite way thus providing proof of the

spinning ball earth once again however

just like Foucault pendulum spinning

either which way sinks in toilets in the

northern and southern hemispheres do not

consistently spin in any one direction

sinks and toilets in the very same

household are often found to spin

opposite directions depending entirely

upon the shape of the basin and the

angle of the water's entry not the

suppose and rotation of the earth 142

people claim that if the earth were flat

they should be able to use a telescope

and see clear across the oceans this is

absurd however as the air is full of

precipitation especially over the oceans

and especially at the lowest densest

layer of atmosphere is not transparent

pictured the blurry haze over roads on

hot humid days even the best telescope

will blur out long before you could see

across an ocean you can however use a

telescope to zoom in much more of our

Flat Earth than would be possible on a

ball 25,000 miles in circumference 143

people claim that if the earth were flat

with the Sun circling over and around us

we should be able to see the Sun from

everywhere all over the earth and there

should be daylight even at night time

since the Sun is not 93 million miles

away but rather

just a few thousand and shining down

like a spotlight once it is moved

significantly far enough away from your

location it becomes invisible beyond the

horizon and daylight slowly fades until

it completely disappears if the Sun were

93 million miles away in the earth a

spinning ball the transition from

daylight to night would instead be

almost instantaneous as you passed the

Terminator line 144 pictures of the moon

appearing upside down in the southern

hemisphere and right-side up in the

North are often cited as proof of the

ball earth but once again upon closer

inspection provide another proof of the

flat model in fact time-lapse

photography shows the moon itself turns

clockwise like a wheel as it circles

over and around the Earth you can find

pictures of the moon at 360 degrees of

various inclination from all over the

earth simply depending on where and when

the picture was taken

145 Helio centrist believed the moon as

a ball even though its appearance is

clearly that of a flat luminous disc we

only ever see the same one face albeit

at various inclinations of the moon yet

it is claimed that there is another Dark

Side of the Moon which remains hidden

NASA states the moon spins opposite the

spin of the earth in such a perfectly

synchronized way that the motions cancel

each other out so we will conveniently

never be able to observe the supposed

Dark Side of the Moon outside of their

terrible fake CGI images fact of the

matter is however if the moon were a

sphere observers in Antarctica would see

a different face from those at the

equator yet they do not just the same

flat face rotated at various degrees 146

the ball earth model claims the moon

orbits around the earth once every 28

days yet it is plain for anyone to see

that the moon orbits around the earth

every single day the moon's orbit is

slightly slower than the Suns but

follows the sun's same paths from topic

to topic solstice to solstice making a

full circle over the earth in just under

25 hours 147 the ball earth model claims

the Sun is precisely 400 times larger

than the moon and 400 times further away

from Earth making them falsely appear

exactly the same size once again the

ball model asks us to accept as

coincidence something that cannot be

explained other than by natural design

the Sun and Moon occupied the same

amount of space in the sky and have been

measured with sextants to be of equal

size and equal distance so claiming

otherwise is against our eyes experience

experiments and common sense 148 quoting

earth not a globe by Samuel Rowbotham it

is found by observation that the Stars

come to the Meridian about 4 minutes

earlier every 24 hours than the Sun

taking the solar time as the standard

this makes 120 minutes every 30 days and

24 hours in the year hence all the

constellations have passed before or in

advance of the Sun at that time this is

the simple fact as observed in nature

with a theory of rotundity and motion on

axis and in an orbit has no place for it

visible truth must be ignored because

this theory stands in the way and

prevents its votaries from my

understanding it 149 throughout

thousands of years the same

constellations have remained fixed in

their same patterns without moving out

of position whatsoever if the earth were

a big ball spinning around a bigger Sun

spinning around a bigger galaxy shooting

off from the biggest bang as NASA claims

it is impossible that the constellations

would remain so fixed based on their

model we should in fact have an entirely

different night sky every single night

and never repeat exactly the same star

pattern twice 150 if earth were a

spinning ball it would be impossible to

photograph star trail time-lapses

turning perfect circles around Polaris

anywhere but the North Pole at all other

vantage points the stars would be seen

to travel more or less horizontally

across the observers horizon due to the

alleged thousand mile per hour motion

beneath their feet in reality however

Polaris's surrounding stars can always

be photographed turning perfect circles

around the central star all the way down

to the Tropic of Capricorn 151 if earth

were spinning ball revolving around the

Sun it would actually be impossible for

star trail photos to show perfect

circles even at the North Pole since the

earth is also allegedly moving 67,000

miles per hour around the Sun the Sun

will beam 500,000 miles per hour around

the Milky Way and the entire galaxy

going 67 million miles per hour these

four contradictory motions would make

star trail time-lapses all show Erik

they're curved lines 152 in 2003 three

University geography professors

collaborated in an experiment to prove

that the state of Kansas is indeed

actually flatter than a pancake using

topographical geodetic survey is

covering over 80 thousand square miles

it was determined that Kansas has a

flatness ratio of 0.99 97 over the

entire state while the average pancake

precisely measured using a confocal

laser microscope comes in at 0.957

making Kansas thereby literally flatter

than a pancake 150 3 quoting Reverend

Thomas Milner's atlas of physical

geography we find that vast areas

exhibit a perfectly dead level scarcely

arise existing through 1,500 miles from

the Carpathians to the Urals south of

the Baltic the country is so flat that a

prevailing north wind will drive the

waters of the Statler half into the

mouth of the Oder and give the river a

backwards flow 30 or 40 miles the plains

of Venezuela and new Grenada in South

America chiefly on the left of the

Orinoco are termed

elinoz or level fields often in the

space of two hundred and seventy square

miles the surface does not vary a single

foot the Amazon only Falls twelve feet

in the last 700 miles of its course the

la plata has only a descent of one

thirty third of an inch per mile 150 for

the felix baumgartner red bull dive

outside camera shows the same amount of

curvature of Earth from surface level to

jump height proving it to be a deceiving

fish-eyed wide-angle lens while the

inside regular camera shows a perfectly

flat horizon eye level at 128 thousand

feet which is only consistent with a

flat plane 155 some people claim to have

seen the curvature of the earth out

there airplane windows the glass used in

all commercial airplanes however is

curved to remain flush with the fuselage

this creates a slight effect mixed with

the confirmation bias people mistake for

being the alleged curvature of the earth

in actuality the fact that you see the

horizon at eye level at 35,000 feet out

both port and starboard windows proves

the earth is flat

if the earth were a ball no matter how

big the horizon would stay exactly where

it was and you would have to look down

further and further to see the horizon

at all looking straight out the window

at 35,000 feet you should see nothing

but outer space from the port and

starboard windows as the earth and

horizon are supposed to be below you if

they are visible at eye level outside

both windows it's because the earth is

flat

156 people also claimed to see curvature

in GoPro or other high altitude camera

footage of the horizon while it is true

that the horizon often appears convex in

such footage it just as often appears

concave or flat depending on the tilt

and movement of the camera

the effect is simply a distortion due to

wide-angle lenses in lens corrected and

footage taken without wide-angle

technology all amateur high altitude

horizon shots appear perfectly flat 157

if gravity magically dragged the

atmosphere along with the spinning ball

earth that would mean the atmosphere

near the equator would be spinning at

over a thousand miles per hour the

atmosphere over the mid-latitudes would

be spinning around 500 miles per hour

and gradually slower to the poles with

the atmosphere would be unaffected at 0

miles per hour in reality however the

atmosphere at every point on earth is

equally unaffected by this alleged force

as it has never been measured or

calculated and proven non existent but

the ability of airplanes to fly unabated

in any direction without experiencing

any such atmospheric changes 158 if

gravity magically dragged the atmosphere

along with the spinning ball earth that

would mean the higher the altitude the

faster the spinning atmosphere would

have to be turning around the center of

rotation in reality however if this were

happening then rain and fireworks would

behave entirely differently as they fell

down through progressively slower and

slower spinning atmosphere hot-air

balloons would also be forced steadily

faster eastwards as they ascended

through the ever increasing atmospheric

speeds 159 if they were progressively

faster and faster spinning atmosphere

the higher the altitude that would mean

it would have to abruptly end at some

key altitude where the fastest layer of

gravity spinning atmosphere meets the

supposed non gravity

to non-spinning nan atmosphere of

infinite vacuum space NASA has never

even mentioned what altitude this

impossible feat allegedly happens but it

is easily philosophically refuted by the

simple fact that vacuums cannot exist

connected to non vacuums while

maintaining the properties of a vacuum

not to mention the effect such a

transition would have on a rocket

spaceship would be disastrous 160 it is

impossible for rockets or any type of

jet propulsion engines to work in the

alleged non atmosphere of vacuum space

because without air or atmosphere to

push against there is nothing to propel

the vehicle forwards instead the rockets

and shuttles would be sent spinning

around their own axis uncontrollably in

all directions like a gyroscope it would

be impossible to fly to the moon or go

in any direction whatsoever especially

if gravity were real and constantly

sucking you towards the closest densest

body 161 if Earth were really a ball

there would be no reason to use rockets

for flying into outer space anyway

because simply flying an airplane

straight at any altitude for long enough

should and would send you off into outer

space to prevent their airplanes from

flying tangent to the ball earth pilots

would have to constantly course-correct

downwards or else within just a few

hours the average commercial airliner

traveling 500 miles per hour would find

themselves lost in outer space the fact

that this never happens

artificial horizons remain level at

pilots desired altitudes and do not

require constant downward adjustments

proves the earth is not a ball 162 all

NASA and other space agencies rocket

launches never go straight up every

rocket forms a parabolic curve peeks out

and inevitably starts falling back to

earth

the Rockets which are declared

successful are those few which don't

explode or start falling too soon but

make it out of range of the spectator

view before crashing down into

restricted waters and recovered there is

no magic altitude where rockets or

anything else can simply go up up up and

then suddenly just start free-floating

in space this is all a science fiction

illusion created by wires green screens

dark pools some permed hair and zero-g

planes 163

NASA and other space agencies have been

caught time and again with air bubbles

forming and floating off in their

official outer space footage astronauts

have also been caught using scuba space

gear kicking their legs to move an

astronaut Luca parmitano even almost

drowned when water started filling up

his helmet while allegedly on a

spacewalk it is admitted the astronauts

train for their spacewalks in underwater

training facilities like NASA's neutral

buoyancy lab but what is obvious from

their space bubbles and other blunders

is that all officials spacewalk footage

is also faked and filmed underwater 160

for analysis of many interior videos

from the International Space Station

have shown the use of camera tricks such

as green screens harnesses and even

wildly permed hair to achieve a

zero-gravity type effect footage of the

astronauts seemingly floating in the

zero-gravity of their space station is

indistinguishable from vomit comet

zero-g airplane footage by flying

parabolic maneuvers this zero-g floating

effect can be achieved over and over

again then edited together for longer

uncut shots nASA has been caught using

simple wires and green screen technology

165 NASA claims one can observe the

International Space Station pass by

overhead proving its existence yet

analysis of the ISS seen through zoom

cameras proves it to be some type of

hologram or drone not a physical

floating space base as you can see in my

documentary ISS hoax when zooming in and

out the ISS dramatically and impossibly

changes shape and color displaying a

prismatic rainbow effect until coming

into focus much like an old television

turning on and off 166 the geostationary

communications satellite was first

created by freemasons science fiction

writer Arthur C Clarke and supposedly

became science fact just a decade later

before this radio television and

navigation systems like Lauren and Decca

were already well established and worked

fine using only ground-based

technologies nowadays huge fiber optic

cables connect the internet across

oceans gigantic cell towers triangulate

GPS signals and I am an aspherical

Gatien allows radio waves to be

all without the aid of the science

fiction bestseller known as satellites

167 satellites are allegedly floating

around in the thermosphere where

temperatures are claimed to be upwards

of four thousand five hundred and thirty

degrees Fahrenheit the medals using

satellites however such as aluminium

gold and titanium have melting points of

1221 1948 and 3034 degrees respectively

all far lower than they could possibly

handle 168 so-called satellite phones

have been found to have reception

problems in countries like Kazakhstan

with very few cell phone towers if the

earth were a ball with twenty

thousand-plus satellites surrounding

such blackouts should not regularly

occur in any rural countryside areas 169

so-called satellite TV dishes are almost

always positioned at a 45-degree angle

towards the nearest ground-based

repeater tower if TV antenna were

actually picking up signals from

satellites 100 plus miles away in space

most TV dishes should be pointing more

or less straight up to the sky the fact

that satellite dishes are never pointing

straight up and almost always positioned

at a 45-degree angle

proves they are picking up ground-based

tower signals and not outer space

satellites 170 people even claim to see

satellites with their naked eyes but

this is ridiculous considering they are

smaller than a bus and allegedly a

hundred plus miles away it is impossible

to see anything so small that far away

even using telescopes no one claims to

discern the shape of satellites but

rather described seeing passing moving

lights which could easily be any number

of things from airplanes to drones to

shooting stars or other unidentified

flying objects 171 NASA claims there are

upwards of 20,000 satellites floating

around Earth's upper atmosphere sending

us radio television GPS and taking

pictures of the planet all these

supposed satellite pictures however are

admittedly composite images edited in

Photoshop they claim to receive ribbons

of imagery from satellites which must

then be spliced together to create

composite images of the earth all of

which are clearly CGI and not

photographs if earth were truly a ball

with 20,000 satellites orbiting it would

be a simple matter to mount a camera and

take some real photographs the fact that

no real satellite photographs from the

supposed ball earth exists in favour of

NASA's ribbons of composite CG imagery

is further proof that we are not being

told the truth

172 if you pick any cloud in the sky and

watch for several minutes two things

will happen

the clouds will move and they will morph

gradually changing shape in official

NASA footage of the spinning ball earth

such as the Galileo time lapse video

however clouds are constantly shown for

24 plus hours at a time and not moving

or morphing whatsoever this is

completely impossible further proof that

NASA produces fake cgi videos and

further evidence that earth is not a

spinning ball 173 NASA has several

alleged photographs of the ball earth

which shows several exact duplicate

cloud patterns the likelihood of having

two or three clouds of the exact same

shape in the same picture is as likely

as finding two or three people with the

exact same fingerprints in fact it is a

solid proof that the clouds were copied

and pasted in a computer program and

that such pictures showing a ball shaped

earth are fakes 174 NASA graphics

artists have placed things like faces

dragons and even the word sex into cloud

patterns over their various ball earth

pictures their recent 2015 Pluto

pictures even clearly have a picture of

Disney's Pluto the dog layered into the

background such blatant fraud goes

unnoticed by the hypnotized masses but

provides further proof of the

illegitimate of NASA and their spinning

ball planet mythos 175 professional

photo analysts have dissected several

NASA images of the ball earth and found

undeniable proof of computer editing for

example images of the earth allegedly

taken from the moon have proven to be

copied and pasted in as evidenced by

rectangular cuts found in the black

background around the earth by adjusting

brightness and contrast levels if they

were truly on the moon and Earth was

truly a ball there would be no need to

fake such pictures 176

when NASA's images of the ball earth are

compared with one another the coloration

of the land and oceans and relative size

of the continents are consistently so

drastically different from one another

as to prove beyond any reasonable doubt

that the pictures are all fake 177 and

the documentary a funny thing happened

on the way to the moon we can watch

official leaked NASA footage showing

Apollo 11 astronauts Buzz Aldrin Neil

Armstrong and Michael Collins for almost

an hour using transparencies and camera

tricks to fake shots of around Earth

they communicate over audio with control

and Houston about how to accurately

stage the shot and someone keeps

prompting them on how to effectively

manipulate the camera to achieve the

desired effect first they blacked out

all the windows except for a downward

facing circular one which they aimed the

camera towards from several feet away

this created the illusion of a ball

shaped earth surrounded by the blackness

of space when in fact it was simply a

round window in their dark cabin Neil

Armstrong claimed at this point to be

130,000 miles from the earth halfway to

the moon but when camera tricks were

finished the viewer could see for

themselves the astronauts were not more

than a couple dozen miles above the

Earth's surface

likely flying in a high-altitude plane

178 people claimed google earth somehow

proves the ball model without realizing

that Google Earth is simply a composite

program of images taken from

high-altitude planes and street-level

car cameras superimposed onto a CGI

model of a ball earth the same could

just as easily be molded onto a square

earth or any other shape and therefore

cannot be used as proof of Earth

certainty

179 if the earth were constantly

spinning eastward a thousand miles per

hour then airplane flight durations

going eastward versus westwards should

be significantly different if the

average commercial airliner travels 500

miles per hour it follows that westbound

equatorial flights should reach their

destination at approximately thrice the

speed as their eastbound

return flights in reality however the

differences in east and westbound flight

durations usually amount to a matter of

minutes and nothing near what would

occur on a thousand mile per hour

spinning ball earth 180 the spinning

ball model dictates that the earth and

atmosphere would be moving together at

approximately 500 miles

per hour at the mid-latitudes we're LA

to New York City flights take place the

average commercial airliner traveling

500 miles per hour takes five and a half

hours traveling east with the alleged

rotation of the earth so that return

flight west should take only 2.75 hours

but in fact we find that the average New

York to LA flight takes six hours a

flight time totally inconsistent with

the spinning ball model 181 flights

eastwards with the alleged spin of the

ball earth from Tokyo to LA take an

average of 10 and a half hours therefore

the return flights westwards against the

alleged spin should take an average of

five and a quarter hours but in actual

fact take an average of eleven and a

half hours another flight time totally

inconsistent with the spinning ball

model 182 flights eastward with the

alleged spin of the ball earth from New

York to London take an average of seven

hours therefore the return flights

westwards against the alleged spin

should take an average of three and a

half hours but in actual fact take an

average of seven and a half hours a

flight time totally inconsistent with

the spinning ball model 183 flights

eastward from Chicago to Boston with the

alleged spin of the ball earth take an

average of two and a quarter hours

therefore the return flights westwards

against the alleged spin should take an

average of just over an hour but natural

fact take an average of two and

three-quarters hours once again

completely inconsistent with the

spinning ball model 184 flights eastward

from Paris to Rome with the alleged spin

of the ball earth take an average of two

hours therefore the return flights

westward against the alleged spin should

take an average of one hour but an

actual fact have an average flight

duration of two hours and ten minutes

flight time totally inconsistent with

the spinning ball model 185 we are told

that the earth and atmosphere spin

together as such a perfect uniform

velocity that no one in history has ever

seen heard felt or measured the suppose

at 1,000 mile per hour movement this is

then often compared to traveling in a

car at uniform velocity where we only

feel the movement during acceleration or

deceleration in reality however even

with eyes closed window

up over smooth tar and a luxury car at a

mere uniform 50 miles per hour the

movement absolutely can be felt at 20

times the speed Earth's imaginary

thousand mile per hour spin would most

certainly be noticeable felt seen and

heard by all 186 people sensitive to

motion sickness feel distinct unease and

physical discomfort from motion nestle

as an elevator or train ride this means

that the thousand mile per hour alleged

uniform spin of the earth has no effect

on such people but at an extra 50 miles

per hour uniform velocity of a car and

their stomach starts turning knots the

idea that motion sickness is nowhere

apparent in anyone at a thousand miles

per hour but suddenly comes about a

thousand fifty miles per hour is

ridiculous and proves the earth is not

in motion whatsoever 187 the second law

of thermodynamics otherwise known as the

law of entropy along with the

fundamental principles of friction and

resistance determine the impossibility

of earth being a uniformly spinning ball

over time the spinning ball earth would

experience measurable amounts of drag

constantly slowing the spin and

lengthening the amount of hours per day

as not the slightest such change has

ever been observed in all of recorded

history it is absurd to assume the earth

has ever moved an inch

188 over the years nASA has twice

changed their story regarding the shape

of the earth at first they maintain

earth was a perfect sphere which later

changed to an oblate spheroid flattened

at the poles and then changed again to

being pear-shaped as the southern

hemisphere allegedly bulges out as well

unfortunately for NASA however none of

their official pictures show an oblate

spheroid or pear shaped earth all their

pictures contrary to their words show a

spherical and clearly CGI fake earth 189

the Bible Koran srimad-bhagavatam and

many other holy books describe and

purport the existence of a geocentric

stationary Flat Earth for example first

Chronicles 1630 and Psalm 96 10 both

reading he has fixed the earth firm

immovable and Psalm 93 one says the

world also established that it cannot be

moved the Bible also repeatedly affirms

that the earth is outstretched as a

plane with the outstretched heavens

every

above not all around giving a scriptural

proof the earth is not a spinning ball

190 cultures the world over throughout

history have all described and reported

the existence of a geocentric stationary

Flat Earth Egyptians Indians Mahon's

Chinese Native Americans and literally

every ancient civilization on earth at a

geocentric Flat Earth cosmology before

Pythagoras the idea of a spinning ball

earth was non-existent and even after

Pythagoras it remained an obscure

minority view until 2,000 years later

when Copernicus began reviving the

heliocentric theory 191 from Pythagoras

to Copernicus Galileo and Newton to

modern astronauts like Aldrin Armstrong

and Collins to director of NASA and

grand commander of the 33rd degree C

Fred Clank necked the founding fathers

of the spinning ball mythos have all

been Freemasons the fact that so many

members of this the largest and oldest

secret society in existence have all

been co-conspirators bringing about this

literal planetary revolution is beyond

the possibility of coincidence and

provides proof of organized collusion in

creating and maintaining this

multi-generational deception 192 quoting

terra firma by David Ward Laska the

system of the universe as taught by

modern astronomers being founded

entirely on theory for the truth of

which they are unable to advance one

single real proof they have entrenched

themselves in a conspiracy of silence

and declined to answer any objections

which may be made to their hypothesis

Copernicus himself who revived a theory

of the heap and philosopher Pythagoras

and his great exponent Sir Isaac Newton

confessed that their system of our

evolving earth was only a possibility

and could not be proved by facts it is

only their followers who have decorated

it with the name of an exact science

yay according to them the most exact of

all the sciences yet one astronomer

royal for England once said speaking of

the motion of the whole solar system the

matter is left in a most delightful

state of uncertainty and I shall be very

glad if anyone can help me out of it but

a very sad position for an exact science

to be in is this 193

no child or an induction ated man in

their right mind would ever conclude or

even conceive given to their own devices

based on their own personal observations

that the earth was a spinning ball

revolving around the Sun such

imaginative theories nowhere present in

anyone's daily experience require and

have required massive amounts of

constant propaganda to uphold the

illusion 194 from David Ward LA Scott

I remember being taught when a boy that

the earth was a great ball revolving at

a very rapid rate around the Sun and

when I expressed to my teacher my fears

that the waters of the oceans would

tumble off I was told that they were

prevented from doing so by Newton's

great law of gravitation which kept

everything in its proper place I

presumed that my continents must have

shown some signs of incredulity from my

teacher immediately added I can show you

a direct proof of this

a man can whirl around his head a pail

filled with water without it being spilt

and so in like manner can the oceans be

carried around the Sun without losing a

drop as this illustration was evidently

intended to settle the matter I then

said no more upon the subject had such

been proposed to me afterwards as a man

I would have answered somewhat as

follows sir I beg to say that the

illustration you have given of a man

whirling a pail of water around his head

and the oceans revolving around the Sun

does not in any degree confirm your

argument because the water in the two

cases is placed under entirely different

circumstances but to be of any value the

conditions in each case must be the same

which here they are not the pail is a

hollow vessel which holds the water

inside it whereas according to your

teaching the earth is a ball with a

continuous curvature outside which in

agreement with the laws of nature could

not retain any water 195 astronomers say

the magical magnetism of gravity is what

keeps the oceans of the world stuck to

the ball earth they claim that because

the earth is so massive by virtue of

this mass it creates a magic force able

to hold people oceans and atmosphere

tightly clung to the underside of the

spinning ball unfortunately however they

cannot provide any practical example of

this on a scale smaller than the

planetary a spinning wet tennis ball for

instance has the exact opposite effect

of the supposed ball earth any water

poured over it simply falls off the

sides and

spin results in water flying off 360

degrees like a dog shaking off after a

bath astronomers concede the wet tennis

ball example displays the opposite

effect of their supposable earth but

claimed that at some unknown mass the

magic adhesive properties of gravity

suddenly kick in allowing the spinning

wet tennis ball earth to keep every drop

of gravities dwarfs duck to the surface

when such an unproven theory goes

against all experiments experience and

common sense it is high time to drop the

theory 196 quoting Marshall Hall in

short the Sun Moon and stars actually

doing precisely what everyone throughout

all of history has seen them do we do

not believe what our eyes tell us

because we've been taught a counterfeit

system which demands that we believe

what has never been confirmed by

observation or experiment that

counterfeit system demands that the

earth rotate on an axis every 24 hours

at a speed of over a thousand miles per

hour at the equator no one has ever ever

ever seen or felt such movement nor seen

or felt the 67,000 mile per hour speed

of Earth's alleged orbit around the Sun

or it's 500,000 mile-per-hour alleged

speed around a galaxy or it's retreat

from an alleged Big Bang at over 67

million miles per hour

remember no experiment has ever shown

the earth to be moving and to that the

fact that the alleged rotational speed

we've all been taught as scientific fact

must decrease every inch or mile one

goes north or south of the equator and

it becomes readily apparent that such

things as accurate aerial bombing in

World War two down a chimney from 25,000

feet with a plane going any direction at

high speed would have been impossible if

calculated on an earth moving below at

several hundred miles per hour and

constantly changing with the latitude

197 some people claim there is no motive

for such a grand scale deception and

that flat or ball makes no difference

by removing earth from the motionless

center of the universe these Mason's

have moved us physically and

metaphysically from a place of supreme

importance to one of complete nihilistic

indifference if the earth is the center

of the universe than the ideas of God

creation and a purpose for human

existence are resplendent but if the

earth is just one of billions of planets

revolving around billions of stars and

billions

the Alexei's than the ideas of God

creation and a specific purpose for

earth and human existence become highly

implausible by surreptitiously

indoctrinating us into their scientific

materialists some worship not only do we

lose faith in anything beyond the

material we gain absolute faith in

materiality superficiality status

selfishness hedonism and consumerism if

there is no God and everyone's just an

accident then all that really matters is

me me me they've turned Madonna the

mother of God into a Material Girl

living in a material world their rich

powerful corporations with the slicks

some cult logos Seles idols to worship

slowly taking over the world while we

tacitly believe their science vote for

their politicians buy their products

listen to their music and watch their

movies sacrificing our souls at the

altars of materialism to quote Morris

Klein the heliocentric theory by putting

the Sun at the center of the universe

made manifest

Wanderers drifting through a cold sky it

seemed less likely that he was born to

live gloriously and to attain paradise

upon his death less likely to was it

that he was the object of gods

administration's 198 some say that the

idea of an intergenerational worldwide

conspiracy to delude the masses sounds

implausible or unrealistic but these

people need only familiarize themselves

with the works and writings of

freemasons themselves for example John

Robinson who exposed this in his 1798

book proofs of a conspiracy against all

the religions and governments of Europe

carried out in the secret meetings of

the Freemasons Illuminati and reading

societies supreme commander of the 33rd

degree Albert Pike was quite forthcoming

in several letters regarding the Masons

ultimate goal of world domination and

the Zionist protocols of the learned

Elders of Zion the exact plan by which

this would be and has been carried out

is completely disclosed 199 from

foundations of many generations by es

Cheney the only thing the fable of their

evolving earth has done it has shown the

terrible power of a lie a lie has the

power to make a man a mental slave so

that he dares not back the evidence of

his own

to deny the plain and obvious movement

of the Sun he sees before him when he

feels himself standing on an earth

utterly devoid of motion at the

suggestion of someone else he's prepared

to accept that he's spinning furiously

around when he sees a bird flying and

gaining over the ground he's prepared to

believe that the ground is really

travelling a great number of times

faster than the bird finally in order to

uphold the imagination of a madman he is

prepared to accuse his maker of forming

for him a sense sephorus lie 200 finally

from dr. Rowbotham thus we see that this

Newtonian philosophy is devoid of

consistency it's details are the result

of an entire violation of the laws of

legitimate reasoning and all its

premises are assumed it is in fact

nothing more than an assumption upon

assumption and the conclusions derived

therefrom willfully considered as things

proved and to be employed as truths to

substantiate the first and fundamental

assumptions such a juggle and jumble of

fancies and falsehoods extended and

intensified as in theoretical astronomy

is calculated to make the unprejudiced

Inquirer revolt with horror from the

terrible conjuration which has been

practiced upon him to sternly resolve to

resist it's further progress to endeavor

to overthrow the entire edifice and to

bury in its ruins the false honours

which have been associated with its

fabricators and which still attached to

its devotees for the learning the

patience the perseverance and devotion

for which they have ever been examples

honor and applause need not be withheld

but their false reasoning the advantages

they have taken of the general ignorant

of mankind in respect to astronomical

subjects and the unfounded theories they

have advanced and defended cannot be

otherwise than regretted and not to be

by every means possible approved
